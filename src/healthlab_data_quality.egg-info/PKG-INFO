# HealthLab: Data Quality

**AI-Driven Anomaly Detection and Plausibility Checks for Healthcare Data**

This research project explores the use of AI and ML to identify data quality issues in healthcare datasets. We focus on detecting implausible records, semantic inconsistencies, and pattern anomalies across structured and unstructured data.

---

## Goals

- Detect anomalies using both traditional ML and deep learning
- Compare patient-level features against peer and historical baselines
- Vectorize unstructured content (e.g., clinical notes) for semantic outlier detection
- Build a hybrid pipeline combining feature-based and embedding-based reasoning
- Demonstrate scalable, modular, and explainable approaches

---

## Key Concepts

- **Feature Stores** for structured fact-based signals
- **Vectorization** for semantic comparisons
- **MLOps** to orchestrate training, deployment, and monitoring
- **Inference** pipelines for real-time or batch anomaly scoring

---

## Example Use Cases

- Detecting implausible clinical scenarios (e.g. mammogram for male child)
- Identifying documentation drift in clinical notes
- Flagging over-coded encounters or missing diagnoses
- Validating data submissions before quality measure calculation

---

## Status

ðŸš§ Early research & prototyping. Contributions welcome.

---

## Future Projects

This repo is part of the broader **HealthLab** research series:

- `healthlab-semantic-mapping`
- `healthlab-interop`
- `healthlab-quality-measures`
